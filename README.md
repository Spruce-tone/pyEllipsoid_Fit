# pyEllipsoid_Fit

A Python adaptation of Yury Petrov's [ellipsoid_fit](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24693-ellipsoid-fit) function for MATLAB.

> Fits an ellipsoid or other conic surface into a 3D set of points approximating such a surface, allows some constraints, like orientation constraint and equal radii constraint. E.g., you can use it to fit a rugby ball, or a sphere. Returns both the algebraic description of the ellipsoid (the nine coefficients of the quadratic form) and the geometric description (center, radii, principal axes).

I used this for calibrating triaxis Magnetometers.
